# [QuIP#: Even Better LLM Quantization with Hadamard Incoherence and Lattice Codebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04396), ICML 2024

QuIP# is a weight-only post-training quantization method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in extreme compression ($\le 4$ bits per weight) regimes.
QuIP# introduces (1) faster and better [incoherence processing](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=xrk9g5vcXR) with the randomized Hadamard transform (RHT), (2) fast vector quantization with $E_8$ lattice-based codebooks, and (3) a fine-tuning scheme to capture inter-layer interactions.
This codebase contains code that allows users to quantize and deploy their own QuIP# models as well as CUDA kernels for fast inference.
Please open a GitHub ticket if you have any questions about the code or QuIP# in general.
Prequantized QuIP# models are available [here](https://huggingface.co/relaxml).

### QuIP# Scaling
QuIP# is the first PTQ method where 3 bit models scale better than theoretically lossless 4 bit models.

## Latest Updates

- **[This PR](https://github.com/Cornell-RelaxML/quip-sharp/pull/65) enables fast HF inference with CUDA graphs! This change lets QuIP# models generate text at over 150 tokens/s.** 
- QuIP# will appear at ICML 2024 in Vienna, Austria. Feel free to visit us if you're around!
- Our latest method, [QTIP](https://github.com/Cornell-RelaxML/qtip), enables ultra high-dimensional quantization with fast inference through a specially designed trellis quantizer. When used as a replacement for E8P in QuIP#, QTIP achieves state-of-the-art results amongst methods that support fast inference. We plan on releasing a joint QuIP#/QTIP PyPI package in the future.

## Installation

- Clone the repo
- Install the requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Build and install the CUDA inference kernels. (`cd quiptools && python setup.py install && cd ../`)
- Install the [fast-hadamard-transform](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/fast-hadamard-transform) package. This package is also available through pip but recently I've had issues installing it through pip.

## Quantization

Example quantization scripts for the Llama family of models are located in `quantize_llama`. Follow these scripts to use QuIP# on other architectures. Within `quantize_llama`:
- `hessian_offline_llama.py` contains code to generate model Hessians. **Hessian calculation uses a `fp64` accumulator for numerical accuracy. Running this script on a device with slow `fp64` capabilities will take longer -- you may want to change the accumulator to `fp32` if so.** The HF repo includes pregenerated Hessians for a variety of models.
    - `--batch_size` Batch size per GPU. Tune so you don't run out of memory.
    - `--devset_size` Size of devset to use for Hessian generation.
    - `--ctx_size` Context size (sequence length) to use for Hessian generation.
    - `--base_model` Full precision HF model.
- `quantize_finetune_llama.py` contains code to quantize llama with fine-tuning ("fine-tuning during quantization" in the paper).
    - To reproduce earlier QuIP# results without fine-tuning, pass `--ft_epochs 0`
    - `--save_path` Output path.
    - `--base_model` Full precision HF model. Llama 1 weights are available at `relaxml/Llama-1-<7,13,30,65>b-hf`.
    - `--hessian_path` Offline Hessians. We provide precomputed Hessians at repo_id's `relaxml/Hessians*-<n>`. These Hessians were computed with `n` samples and the context length and attention mask used to train the original model. To download them, run `python scripts/download_hf.py --folder_path <local path to save Hessians> --repo_id <repo_id> --read_token <huggingface read token>`.
    - `--codebook` Codebook. Use `E8P12` for 2 bits, `E8P12RVQ3B` for 3 bits, and `E8P12RVQ4B` for 4 bits (RVQ stands for residual vector quantization).
    - `--scale_override` and `--resid_scale_override`. Post-incoherence processing scale overrides. We suggest using 0.9 for `E8P12` and the default scales for 3 and 4 bit models. You may want to manually tune these for your specific model.
    - `--ft*` Various fine tuning arguments. `--ft_grad_ckpt` turns on gradient checkpointing and `--ft_train_mode` manifests the full quantized matrix during fine-tuning. We recommend turning `--ft_train_mode` on if you have enough memory since it makes training go faster.
- `finetune_e2e_llama.py` tunes the sign vectors (SU/SV), layernorms, and language model head of a given model (the second fine-tuning step in the paper). The arguments are similar to `quantize_finetune_llama.py`. You will need to convert the output of that script to a Hf model with `hfize_llama.py` before running this script. The HF-ized model should be passed in through `--hf_path`.
- `hfize_llama.py` converts a quantized model to the HF format. 

### I want to quantize a non-Llama architecture model, what do I do?

The scripts in `quantize_llama` are written with the Llama architecture in mind.
However, QuIP# is adaptable to any architecture with linear layers. 
To use QuIP# on a new architecture, identify the relevant linear layers and update the scripts in `quantize_llama`.
Feel free to open a GitHub issue if you run into issues.
    
## Evaluation

`eval` contains evaluation scripts. These scripts may need `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` if you run into CUDA errors due to how HF accelerate works. 
- `eval_ppl.py` calculates perplexity on Wikitext2 and C4.
- `eval_zeroshot.py` calculates performance on zeroshot tasks.
- `eval_speed.py` times the forward pass for one token.

## Fast Inference and Text Generation
QuIP# was designed to support fast inference. Example inference kernels for recent NVIDIA GPUs can be found in the `quiptools` folder.
We are currently missing a 1 bit matrix-vector multiply kernel needed to make 3 bit inference fast, so if you'd like to contribute feel free to open a pull request.

`eval/interactive_gen.py` contains a very simple interactive generation script. 
This script is very rudimentary and you may want to write your own - all it does is call HF's `.generate()` function.
**HF generate does not currently work out-of-the-box with CUDA graphs. Thus, this script will be very slow since most of the time is spent on kernel launches.**
QuIP# should work with any codebase and people have reported success integrating it with vLLM, so we may switch away from HF in the future -- the purpose of this codebase is to provide a reference implementation for QuIP#.

**[Update] https://github.com/Cornell-RelaxML/quip-sharp/pull/65 adds CUDA graph support to HF, so this codebase will support fast inference soon!**

## Model Zoo
Example quantized models (mostly Llama 1 and 2) can be found on our [HF repo](https://huggingface.co/relaxml). 
To use them, pass the given HF repo_id to `--hf_path`.
The 3 bit models are currently significantly slower than the 2 and 4 bit models during generation since we have not written an optimized matvec CUDA kernel for them yet.
Feel free to open a pull request with a link to your own quantized QuIP# model if you want us to list it here.

### Third Party Implementations

https://github.com/chu-tianxiang/QuIP-for-all contains a third party implementation of QuIP#. We have not verified the correctness of the repo, but it seems to work properly and has out of the box integration with other frameworks (vLLM, gpt-fast, etc).
